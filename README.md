你好！今天是2016年四月九日, 星期六。

I've been dabbling in Mandarin and wanted to increase my exposure to the language in a very passive / non-intrusive way.  In highscool, my French teacher made us start each lesson by writing our the full date so I suppose that she is the inspiration for this idea.

I'm by no means a bash (or Mandarin) expert but wanted some practise so that's why this is a shell script. Would appreciate any feedback! :)
