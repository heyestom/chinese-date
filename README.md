# chinese-date
A friendly script to greet you with the current date in Mandarin Chinese.

Place this script on your ````$PATH```` and invoke from your bash/zsh/\*shrc and you'll recvive a friendly greeting informing you of the current day and date in Mandarin.

你好！今天是星期五, 八日四月2016年。

I've been dabbling in Mandarin and wanted to increase my exposure to the language in a very passive / non-intrusive way.  In highscool, my French teacher made us start each lesson by writing our the full date so I suppose that she is the inspiration for this idea.

I'm by no means a bash (or Mandarin) expert but wanted some practise so that's why this is a shell script. Would appreciate any feedback! :)
